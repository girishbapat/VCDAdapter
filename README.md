# Oject Storage Extension Samples

## Overview
[VMware Cloud Director Object Storage Extension](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director-Object-Storage-Extension/index.html) (OSE) is a midware which provides the capability of consuming object storage services for Cloud Director users.

Since version 2.0, OSE opens the extensibility framework for vendor and community to integrate third-party S3 compliant object storage platforms with Cloud Director. The extensibility framework offers a set of REST APIs for the vendor to implement upon the third-party object storage platform, called Object Storage Interoperability Services (OSIS). Below diagram gives the overview of OSE architecture and OSIS' position in the system.

This open source project includes sample implentation of extensively integrated object storage platforms for OSE, but not limited to these.

## Samples
[OSIS Instruction](vmware-ose-osis-instruction/) gives overview of OSIS deveployment and deployment.
* [OSIS CEPH Reference Implementation](vmware-ose-osis-ceph-ri/) is an implementation of OSIS for CEPH.
* [OSIS Stub](vmware-ose-osis-stub/) is a Java REST client stub of OSIS specification.
* [OSIS Verifier](vmware-ose-osis-verifier/) is a tool to verify the readiness and compatibiity of the OSIS implementation.

[Common Test Suites](vmware-ose-common-test-suites/) is developed based on [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) to verify the compatibility of OSE certified storage platforms, like Clouian HyperStore and DELL ECS.
